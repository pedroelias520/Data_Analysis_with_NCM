# Data_Analysis_with_NCM
In this case, we have an algorithm that performs the filtering of NCM (Mercosur Common Nomenclature), which deals with the identification of products for tax purposes in the Brazilian territory.
With the algorithm produced, we can extract important data for analysis and after performing analysis on the available codes, analyzing elements such as:

*Number of repetitions
*Items with more number of repetitions

So we can more easily define NCM's of specific items more easily
